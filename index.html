              >Hi, I am Amina Yahaya Baba, a Front-end Developer. I chose to
              start learning front-end web development because I was always
              intrigued whenever I visited websites with awesome user
              interactions. Especially those that made me want to keep
              revisiting. I was also very curious as to how a website was built
              to solve a certain problem or provide certain service i.e
              E-commerce websites, Video streaming Websites etc There's so much
              more about tech skills I want to learn that I get really excited
              when I meet people from all subset fields of Software
              development.</i

              >I learnt that CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a dynamic tool
              used in styling websites by formatting html elements to your
              desire. Css Box Model is the standard representation of an html
              element that is made up of the content, padding, border and
              margin. For best practice it's recommended to always reset the
              box-model of your website to standard using the css property
              <code>{box-sizing: border-box;}.</code> This would allow the
              height, width, border and padding you assign to an element's
              content to be included into the total height & width displayed by
              a browser.</i

              >The difference between paddings, margins and borders:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Padding is the space that's displayed on the inner side of an
                  element which wraps around the content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Border is a thick line that wraps around the padded element's
                  content. It's displayed after the padding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Margin is the space that's displayed at the outer side of an
                  element's content. It wraps around the padding and border of
                  an element.
